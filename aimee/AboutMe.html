        <p>In addition to my studies in Design, I have a keen interest in Computer Science. I have taken several courses in programming languages and have experience working with data structures, algorithms, and software development methodologies. I believe that my knowledge in both design and computer science can complement each other and enable me to create unique and innovative solutions to complex problems.</p>

I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see where my education and experience will take me in the future. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I look forward to sharing more with you.</p>
